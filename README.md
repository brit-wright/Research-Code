# Project Overview
Hello! Thanks for dropping by! This repo stores files for 'phase 1' of research I did for Summer 2025. The 
goal of my project was to develop a path-planning algorithm and model-based controller for the Unitree Go2 
quadruped. Phase 1 involved implementing CPU-based RRT and GPU-parallelized RRT planners. 
[Phase 2](https://github.com/brit-wright/IRIS_env_drake) involved using convex decomposition through 
[IRIS and pydrake](https://drake.mit.edu/pydrake/) to decompose a map into convex regions of freespace
and using it to plan. Finally, [Phase 3](https://github.com/brit-wright/mujoco_stuff) involved building
and simulating a model-based controller for the Go2 quadruped in Mujoco simulation.
